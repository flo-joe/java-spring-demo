# About the project
This project is a simple demo application to showcase usage of Java with Spring Boot.

The application uses the following:

Java 8.
Spring Framework (Spring Boot + Spring MVC).
Embedded Tomcat (for quicker app launch).
Embedded In-Memory Database (very useful during initial development).
Thymeleaf (webpage template resolution engine).
Apache Maven (to handle dependencies).
JPA (Java Persistence API - to map Java objects to DB objects).
DevTools (mainly for auto re-launching app after code changes).
